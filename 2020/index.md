# Most Machine Learning projects never see the light of day

With the advent of internet-scale data gathering, powerful big data platforms and new computing paradigms, 
most companies have embraced the Big Data revolution first and its sibling, the AI revolution, later.  As a result, 
billions have been invested into tools, services and teams to build all-mighty, data-powered 
features and services, in the hope of getting a competitive edge ahead of slower competitors. 

But alas, now that the dust is settling, a growing number of companies are starting to ponder: is 
this huge investment paying off? Is my bright, PhD-holding, Data Science team delivering on its promises?

The sad answer is that in many cases, our Return on Investment is not great. And it is not necessarily our fault.

## Data Science is hard to bring to production

If you have been in the Data Science business for long enough, the following situation will likely sound familiar:

* You or one of your peers have a promising idea on how to apply Machine Learning to solve a problem
* You build a proof-of-concept, a prototype, using existing open-source libraries and lots of spaghetti code
run from a Jupyter Notebook
* Your Product Manager or Engineering Manager, loves the prototype and asks the Big Question: **when can we ship it?**

At this point you realize that you are not quite sure about the answer... How will you deploy the model? 
What infrastructure will it run on? The prototype kind of works, but will it generalize well to completely unseen data? 
How will you re-train it with a larger dataset? How will you work with other peers to iterate on the current model?

But you say something like "a couple of Sprints?" and hope for the best... only to realize 6 Sprints later that
the model isn't yet life and everyone is starting to wonder whether the time investment is worth it.

# Join our course and get better at shipping Machine Learning models

Luckily at this point there are a number of people and companies (including us) who have been facing these problems
for a few years. In our experience, the key elements for successful ML deployment are:

1. Working with iteration and deployment in mind, from the start
2. Using tools and practices from Software Development
3. Knowing the basics of Data Engineering and DevOps to become more autonomous

The course will consist of theory and practical hands-on sessions lead by our four instructors, with over 20 years of
cumulative experience building and deploying Machine Learning models to demanding production environments at 
top-tier internet companies like edreams, letgo or La Vanguardia.

## 2020 Syllabus [Tentative]

*Warning*: We are trying to come up with the most relevant content so this syllabus is still work-in-progress, which means it is susceptible to change. 

* Part I: Reproducibility & best practices for iteration and speed		
	* Conda, docker, makefiles
	* git
	* Python for pros 
	* Testing
	
* Part II: Production-grade training & ETLs
	* Airflow
	* Google Cloud Platform: BigQuery, GC Storage

* Part III: Production-grade deployment	
	* Container-based deployments
	* Kubernetes

## Past editions

We organized a [June 2019 edition of this course](https://mlinproduction.github.io/2019/) in Barcelona, Spain. 
100% of our post-course survey respondents said they would recommend it to a friend, and we have incorporated their suggestions
on how to make it better for this 2020 edition.

## Intended audience

This course is designed for Data Scientists with some development experience who want to:
- Become more independent from SW developers
- Become better data scientists by becoming better SW engineers
- Understand methodologies and processes to develop models at scale
- Adopt techniques and processes to better work in multidisciplinary teams
