# What you are going to learn?

We are going to work with many different components necessary to put models into production
- How to work with cloud technologies
- Data preprocessing pipelines
- Deploying scikit learn and tensorflow models in production
- Best practices

In these lessons, we are going to introduce and use technologies such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving), ... 


# Who is it for?

Data Scientists with limited development experience who want to:
- Become more independent from SW developers
- Become better data scientists by becoming better SW engineers
- Understand methodologies and processes to develop models at scale
- Adopt techniques and processes to better work in multidisciplinary teams
