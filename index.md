# What will you learn?

This course will introduce several tools that a succesful Data Scientist needs to master in order to maximize her impact:
- Working with cloud platforms
- Developing data processing pipelines
- Deploying scikit-learn and tensorflow models in production
- Good development practices for Data Scientists

The course will consist of mostly practical hands-on sessions.
